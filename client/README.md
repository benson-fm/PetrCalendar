## Overview
The University of California, Irvine has built a reputable campus-culture identity centered around "derpier" stickers of its mascot Peter the Anteater with Petr stickers. Petrs are individuals who dress up in costumes to hide their secret identity and drop Petr stickers at specific locations around campus that give a different take on the mascot with pop-culture influences. 

Given the busy livelihood of college students and trying to fit these runs to get a sticker themselves, time conflicts can emerge and the difficulty to go through all Petr accounts and label it within their calendar can be lengthy. 

This is why I built the tool, PetrCalendar. PetrCalendar takes a weekly image as input that's provided by the Petr Community in all the drops that are occurring that week and runs the image through an OCR. The data from that image is then formatted to be in a ICS file format allowing the user to go through a few clicks until they have integrated all the drops and their times within their calendar allowing for efficient planning on Petr drops for students. 


I'm still currently working on the logic to create the ICS files and formatting the data from the OCR!
